# universe-code-katas

## Overview

The `universe-code-katas` repository serves as a comprehensive archive of coding challenges—commonly referred to as 'katas'—originally featured on the CodeWars platform. Aimed at developers, data scientists, and programming enthusiasts, this collection offers an opportunity to delve into a variety of problems that cover multiple facets of software development and computational thinking. The repository is designed to be language-agnostic, containing solutions to each kata in multiple programming languages whenever possible. The primary goal is to create a robust, multi-language library that assists in skill-building, fosters a deeper understanding of programming paradigms, and provides a reliable resource for technical interview preparation.
